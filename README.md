### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Phil, a software engineer with over a decade of experience, residing in sunny Los Angeles, California.

ðŸŒŸ This new GitHub account marks the beginning of my journey in the open source community. Despite my years in the field, I've had limited opportunities to contribute. It's time for a change.

ðŸš€ My career led me down the path of building distributed systems that served millions of users. But lately, I've rekindled my love for Ruby and Rails â€” simple, yet so productive.

ðŸ“š You might find me blogging about my experiences, challenges, and discoveries as I go on this new journey of mine.
